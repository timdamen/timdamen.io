<p className="font-bold">Hello! Iâ€™m Tim Damen, a hands-on front-end lead with experience in guiding DevOps teams to build robust web applications. My working journey includes roles at organizations such as <a href="https://www.rabobank.nl/" target="_blank">Rabobank</a>, <a href="https://www.abnamro.nl/" target="_blank">ABN AMRO</a>, and <a href="https://www.iodigital.com/" target="_blank">iO</a>.</p>

As a passionate web aficionado with over a decade of experience, I've been involved in developing web applications that have reached millions of people. My expertise primarily lies in front-end architecture, optimizing performance, Accessibility, improving developer experiences, and leading development teams.

In my role as an accessibility lead, I've honed the skills necessary to address and resolve accessibility challenges on a large scale. Additionally, I'm invested in creating tools that empower my fellow developers to innovate more efficiently. My work often involves extending [NX](https://nx.dev) and diving into the JavaScript AST to automate scaffolding and life cycle management in applications on a large scale.

The last years, my focus has shifted towards education and mentorship. I've conducted numerous workshops covering a range of topics from accessibility, JavaScript and NX to performing accessibility audits and presenting at various conferences. My goal is to share knowledge and inspire others in the tech community.
